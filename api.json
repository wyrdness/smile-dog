      "full": "Smile Dog (Smile.jpg) is a fictional creepypasta that originated around 2008 on 4chan's /x/ (paranormal) board. The story describes a cursed image depicting a Siberian Husky with an unnaturally wide, human-like smile in a dark room, sometimes accompanied by a humanoid hand. According to the fictional narrative, viewing this image causes nightmares, psychological distress, and a compulsion to 'spread the word' by showing it to others. This is DOCUMENTED FICTION—a creative horror story that became an important part of early internet folklore and digital horror culture. There is no actual cursed image; Smile Dog represents a cultural phenomenon in online storytelling and meme evolution."
